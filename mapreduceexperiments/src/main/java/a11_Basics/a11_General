         -  Negotiates with the Scheduler for the first container(which is the ApplicationMaster)
         
   #  ApplicationMaster
         
         
   #  Node Manager
      +  Application Master
         -  Application specifier container negotiation with RM is handler by ApplicationMaster
      +  Container
         -  An abstraction for Resource in YARN
         -  Map & Reduce jobs, Application Master gets executed inside a Container 
                       
   #  HDFS
      +  NameNode    Has Meta data of HDFS
